(answers)

1. The Web App name of my Website is "BEAT COVID-19".
2. My motivation while doing this Web App is my Oldest Brother because he's doing his best just to pay my tuition.
3. SITEMAP - file:///C:/Users/Angela/OneDrive/Desktop/WD/SABANDO_Outline_and_SiteMap.pdf
   WIREFRAME - file:///C:/Users/Angela/OneDrive/Desktop/WD/WIREFRAME/SABANDO_WD_WIREFRAME.pdf
   VIDEO PITCH - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BBGmDPuWdUNGf7LadzwpQ-tWOat4GzDl/view?usp=sharing
4. The web tools that I used is CSS3, HTML5, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 4
5. (a) I learned how to put a understandable protocols to my web app and while i'm doing the do's and don'ts I realized
       that we need to follow this and while i'm look for articles and updates for my web app, I realized that we need to be careful
       and we need our presence of mind the this COVID-19 is not easy.
   (b) I learned about this course/subject is that, to know about HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap4, etc. because of this
       I can now realized that if we don't know about this web tools, we can't design and create a website nice and appropriate for our users.
6. It's time consuming..because, sometimes every time we need to do some task, we can't create the task within 2 days,
   because even though we know about the web tools it doesn't mean that we're like a pro or something..so, I can say that, over all
   it is TIME CONSUMING.
